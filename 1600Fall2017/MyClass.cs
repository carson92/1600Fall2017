		//A coding convention is a set of guidelines for a specific programming language. Also known as syntax, this is a set of rules that you need to follow so you don't have errors and the computer can understand as well as people. 
		//Exapmle 1. When starting a code, assigning it to a specific program, you need to start with using insert.program
		//Example 2. When starting a new line, you should type void Start
		//Example 3. After void Start in a line you should put (parameters)
		//Example 4. Then {functions}
		//Example 5. When adding parameters you start with the object, then put my object = "assign to object" For example bottle myBottle = "water"
		//Rule 1. Always end a line with ;
		//Rule 2. Always close paranthesis
